# PAGId
This package implements the CIDP and IDP algorithms for identifying (conditional) causal effects from a Partial Ancentral Graph (PAG). Technical details are provided in the NeurIPS 2022 paper by Jaber A., Ribeiro A. H., Zhang J., and Bareinboim E., (2022) entitled ["Causal Identification under Markov equivalence: Calculus, Algorithm, and Completeness"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/17a9ab4190289f0e1504bbb98d1d111a-Abstract-Conference.html).
